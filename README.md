# Bibu LCD 3x

This repository contains my attempt at an LCD shader for [Magpie](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie) inspired by the feel of playing a game on a Nintendo DS. It is intended for low resolution games using 3x scaling.

## Notes

- I had no experience with shaders prior to the making of this project, so I made heavy use of Chat GPT to get it to a working state. Things may not be perfect.

## Usage

Feel free to use this shader however you like. Credit isn't required, but would be appreciated when sharing or using it publicly.
